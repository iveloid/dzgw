CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:5 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindPoppler.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "Poppler", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Poppler" with any
  of the following names:

    PopplerConfig.cmake
    poppler-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "Poppler" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "Poppler_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "Poppler" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
